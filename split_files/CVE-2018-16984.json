The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the 'view' permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes."}]}}
