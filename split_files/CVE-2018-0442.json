The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles CAPWAP keepalive requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP keepalive packet to a vulnerable Cisco WLC device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of device memory, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information."}]}}
