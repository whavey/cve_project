The vulnerability is due to the absence of user authentication requirements for certain pages that are part of the web interface and contain confidential information for an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device and examining the HTTP response to the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view configuration parameters, including the administrator password, for the affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg92739, CSCvh60172."}]}}
