The vulnerability is due to a missing boundary check in an internal function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an affected device and its configured TCP syslog server and then maliciously modifying the TCP header in segments that are sent from the syslog server to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust buffer on the affected device and cause all TCP-based features to stop functioning, resulting in a DoS condition. The affected TCP-based features include AnyConnect SSL VPN, clientless SSL VPN, and management connections such as Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, and HTTPS."}]}}
