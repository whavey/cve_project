The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles FTP control connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted FTP connection to transfer a file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a file policy that is configured to apply the Block upload with reset action to FTP traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh70130."}]}}
