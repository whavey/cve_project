The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier and 2.0.0.M1 through 2.0.0.M7 is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the 'run_user' to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the 'run_user' requires shell access to the server. Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using the embedded launch script are not susceptible."}]}}
