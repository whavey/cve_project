The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.
