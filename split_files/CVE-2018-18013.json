If this service is supplied with raw serialised Java objects, it deserialises them back into Java objects in memory, giving rise to a remote code execution vulnerability.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability, stating it is 'already mitigated by the internal firewall that limits access to configuration services to localhost.'"}]}}
