The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of extremely long routing updates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large routing update. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger inconsistency between the FIB and the RIB, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCus84718."}]}}
